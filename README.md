GUI: https://app.netlify.com/sites/delicate-kringle-624cce/

Description:

This sample project is managing gateways - master devices that control multiple peripheral
devices.
It is a REST service (JSON/HTTP) for storing information about these
gateways and their associated devices. 

Programming language: JavaScript
Framework: Node.js/JavaScript + React
Database: MongoDB


Each gateway has:
- [x] a unique serial number (string) 
- [x] human-readable name (string),
- [x] IPv4 address (to be validated),
- [x] multiple associated peripheral devices.
Each peripheral device has:
- [x] a UID (number),
- [x] vendor (string),
- [x] date created,
- [x] status - online/offline.

- [ ] Provide an automated build.
- [x] Provide basic unit tests.
